    <h1>Reverse Seared Prime Rib</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've perfected this reverse-sear prime rib, finally, after years of experimenting with different cooking methods for a standing rib roast. We feature this for a special Christmas dinner every year. Dry-brining the prime rib the day before roasting means every bite is flavorful, and slow-roasting at a low temperature followed by a high-heat sear ensures a delicious medium-rare doneness throughout with a savory herb crust.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>1 (10 pound) bone-in standing rib roast</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li> 
           <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li> 
           <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li> 
           <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme</li> 
           <li>ground black pepper to taste</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li> 
               <li>Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li> 
               <li>Remove roast from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature.</li> 
               <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li> 
               <li>Mix butter, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper together in a small bowl.</li> 
               <li>Spread butter mixture over roast. Place roast in a large roasting pan.</li> 
               <li>Bake roast in the preheated oven until internal temperature reaches 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and tent with aluminum foil; allow to rest, about 20 minutes.
               </li> 
               <li>Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li> 
               <li>Once the oven has come up to temperature, uncover rested roast and return it to the oven. Bake until well-browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
