    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lobster roll recipe is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy lunch that will impress your friends. I grew up in Nova Scotia, where seafood was cheap. My mom and grandmothers had some pretty inventive ways of making lobster not dull. Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune! I've paid over $10 for a lobster roll in Cape Cod, and it wasn't half as good — or as big — as this one!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buttered rolls:</strong> Lightly butter hot dog buns or kaiser rolls. </li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You’ll need lettuce leaves, green onions, and celery. </li>
            <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> The creamy, savory sauce starts with mayonnaise. </li>
            <li><strong>Lime juice:</strong> Lime juice lends brightness to the mayo-based sauce. You can substitute lemon juice if you prefer. </li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> The sauce is flavored with hot sauce, salt, and pepper. The lobster is topped with dried basil, tarragon, or parsley. </li>
            <li><strong>Lobster:</strong> You’ll need 1 ½ pounds of cooked and cured lobster meat to make four lobster rolls. </li>
        </ul>
